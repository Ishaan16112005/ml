🌧️ Rain Prediction Using Random Forest

This project predicts whether it will rain tomorrow using a machine-learning model trained on historical London weather data.
The model uses a fine-tuned Random Forest Classifier that works on features such as cloud cover, sunshine, radiation, temperature, precipitation, pressure, and snow depth.

📌 1. Project Goal

To determine Rain Tomorrow (0 = No, 1 = Yes) based on today’s weather values using the London Weather Dataset.

The model uses the following key weather parameters:

Cloud Cover

Sunshine

Global Radiation

Max Temperature

Mean Temperature

Min Temperature

Precipitation

Pressure

Snow Depth

📂 2. Dataset

Dataset: London Weather Observations
Format: CSV

A new label RainTomorrow is generated by checking the next day’s precipitation:

RainTomorrow = 1 if next day precipitation ≥ 1 mm
RainTomorrow = 0 otherwise

⚙️ 3. Workflow Overview
✔️ Data Preparation

Handled in main.py and parts/data_preprocessing.py

Loads CSV with pandas

Converts date

Sorts dataset

Fills missing numeric values using mean

✔️ Feature Engineering

Handled in parts/feature_engineering.py

Selects useful features

Creates the RainTomorrow label

Finalizes X (features) and y (target)

✔️ Train/Test Split

80% training, 20% testing

Stratified split to preserve rain/no-rain ratio

✔️ Model Training & Tuning (train_model.py)

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for:

number of estimators

depth

minimum split

minimum leaf

max features

✔️ Evaluation

Outputs generated in train_model.py:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Heatmap

Classification Report

Feature Importance graph

🤖 4. Prediction Function (rain_predictor.py)

rain_predictor.py contains an input-based function:

predict_rain_simple()

It asks the user for today’s weather details and prints:

🌧️ Rain Tomorrow: YES
or
☀️ Rain Tomorrow: NO

📦 5. Requirements
